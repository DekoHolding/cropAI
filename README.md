Crop Disease identification using Tensorflow

We will use Google Tensorflow image classification as the starting point (link https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/models/image_classification/overview and 
TensorFlow Lite Image Classification Android Example Application https://github.com/tensorflow/examples/tree/master/lite/examples/image_classification/android)

In order to be able to develop multi-platform App (Web, Android, Windows, Linux), we choose Kivy - Open source Python library  as core development platform. To learn more about Kivy, please check https://kivy.org
